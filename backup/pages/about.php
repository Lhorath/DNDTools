        <!-- Introduction -->
        <p>Welcome, adventurer, to this humble corner of the web! Dack's DND Tools was forged from a passion for tabletop role-playing games, with the goal of providing a free, simple, and elegant suite of tools for players and Dungeon Masters alike.</p>

        <!-- Our Philosophy Section -->
        <div>
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold title-font pt-4 pb-2">Our Philosophy</h2>
            <p>We believe that technology should enhance the TTRPG experience, not complicate it. Our tools are designed to be intuitive and fast, getting out of your way so you can focus on what truly matters: weaving epic stories with your friends. We aim for a clean, classic aesthetic that evokes the feeling of a well-loved player's handbook while providing modern convenience.</p>

            <p>This website brings together four core tools to streamline your game:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 mt-4 pl-4">
                <li>
                    <strong>The Character Sheet:</strong> A fully-featured digital version of the classic 5th Edition sheet. It saves your data directly in your browser, automatically calculates modifiers, and allows you to download a PDF copy for printing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Dice Roller:</strong> A versatile dice roller that handles simple d20 checks and complex multi-dice damage rolls with modifiers. It keeps a running history of your rolls for easy reference.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Compendium:</strong> Your quick-reference guide to the D&D 5th Edition Systems Reference Document (SRD). Effortlessly search for spells, monsters, magic items, and more.
                </li>
                 <li>
                    <strong>The Initiative Tracker:</strong> A straightforward tool to manage turn order during combat. Add combatants, sort them by their initiative rolls, and easily advance to the next turn to keep your encounters running smoothly.
                </li>
            </ul>

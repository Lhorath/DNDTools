# Dack's DND Tools - .htaccess
# ============================
# This file enables friendly URLs by redirecting all relevant requests
# to the main index.php router.
#

# SECTION 1: ENABLE REWRITE ENGINE
# This line activates the Apache URL rewriting module.
RewriteEngine On

# SECTION 2: REDIRECT BASE URL
# This rule permanently redirects requests for the bare domain (e.g., yoursite.com)
# to the /home URL (yoursite.com/home) for a consistent user experience.
RewriteRule ^$ /home [R=301,L]

# SECTION 3: EXCEPTION RULES
# These conditions prevent the main routing rule from applying to requests
# for actual files (like style.css or main.js) or existing directories.
# This ensures that all site assets can be loaded correctly by the browser.
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d

# SECTION 4: MAIN ROUTING RULE
# This is the core rule for friendly URLs. It captures any requested URL that is not
# a real file or directory and passes it to index.php as a 'url' parameter.
# For example, a request for yoursite.com/about becomes a server-side request for
# index.php?url=about, allowing PHP to handle the routing.
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?url=$1 [L,QSA]
